Mission StatementB & W Meet is an informal pub meet for Bournemouth-based digital creatives. It doesn't matter where you're from or how experienced you are as long as you're passionate about the web. We’ll always be free and open to all.

NB> I realise this isn't very punchy for a poster but feel free to take snippets or I can write something specifically for a poster but here's the mission statement.
